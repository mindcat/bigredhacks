### brainstorming
- location based journaling/memories/notes?
    - could also market it as a travel journal??? or a geotagged journal, right? "experiences are just as spatial as they are chronological: our application allows adventurers to preserve their memories and recommendations geospatially and share them with their friends and family in a minimalist way that doesn't distract from their experiences." you know?
    - I think touching on "there is a renewed interest in single purpose applications and devices: the feature drowning of corporate apps and social media is overwhelming, and the attitude a lot of not traditionally social apps are taking that they should add social elements (mostly for the purposes of driving engagement and making people make their friends join) is starting to be noticed by consumers. I'm pretty sure meta recently had some talk where they mentioned that user engagement with new features on Instagram has declined significantly in the past few years: stories were exciting, but since, things like multi user posts, the weird little daily note in ur profile, etc are seeing limited responses because people are simply overwhelmed."
    - and thats driving people towards note taking apps that organize themselves closer to typewriters, calenders without integration or feature bloat, and recent successes like bereal are a result of a far more focused, single feature philosophy.
